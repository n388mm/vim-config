# Personal Fork of Derek Wyatt's Vim Configuration

Yup... it's a vim configuration.

To install it, do the following:

* Wipe out your `~/.vimrc` file and `~/.vim` directory (back up if you wish)
* `git clone https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-config.git ~/.vim`
* `cd ~/.vim/bundle && ./get`
* `ln ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
* Start Vim

Occassionally, the bundles may need updating.  To do this, `cd ~/.vim && ./update`

Changes made:

* Added Dash.vim, Funcoo.vim, and Vim-Airline to bundle script.
* Tweaks to vimrc for iTerm2 colors.
